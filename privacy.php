            <h4>What personal information do we collect from the people visiting our website?</h4>

                from
                their school, so no signup is required. In this case, no private information is given to the application
                and
                hence we don't store any information about the user apart from the username and password.</p>
            <h4>How is our website protected?</h4>
            <p>Both our app and website are reviewed on a daily basis so that there are no security or vulnerability
                issues,
                thus it makes our website extremely safe to visit. It is just the access to us and your school, so that
                means that no other third party is involved, meaning extra protection.</p>
            <h4>Do we use cookies?</h4>

                better and improvised services</p>
            <h4>Is a third party interacting with the application?</h4>
            <p>There is two third party services - Vimeo and Youtube - that will be interacting with our application, to
                facilitate of playing video lectures. The rest is our own application.</p>
            <h4>Transfer of personal information.</h4>
            <p>No personal information is going to be transferred to any other party. It is because we don't store any
                information about the user using the application, hence the privacy is kept up to date</p>
